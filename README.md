Applay – App Marketplace UX/UI Design
📌 Project Concept

Applay is a hybrid app marketplace interface that combines the structured ecosystem of the App Store with the dynamic discovery model of Google Play Store.

The goal was to design a modern, scalable, and user-focused digital app marketplace that improves app discovery, categorization, and engagement across both mobile and web platforms.

🎯 Core Idea

Existing app stores often suffer from:

Overloaded discovery pages

Algorithm-driven recommendations without clarity

Visual inconsistency between mobile and web

Weak categorization logic

Applay reimagines the marketplace experience by:

Prioritizing curated content

Improving app visibility through structured layouts

Creating a balanced discovery + search model

Designing a consistent cross-platform interface

👤 Target Audience

Mobile-first users

Tech-savvy users who explore new apps

Developers looking for better app visibility

Users who prefer clean and minimal interfaces

🧠 UX Strategy

This project includes:

Marketplace information architecture planning

Category and discovery structure design

App detail page UX optimization

Rating & review interaction design

Responsive layout adaptation (Mobile & Web)

The focus was reducing cognitive load while improving navigation clarity.
